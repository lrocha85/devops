# brasileirao_api

Example project we will use python to build an simple api to return **Brazilian National Soccer Championship** (a.k.a Brasileir√£o) classification table.


In this example we will:

- clean and format the extracted data.

 - build and endpoint to retrieve cleaned data.

For this we will use the following packages/tools:
